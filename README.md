# Cours in "Integrify".

## Main task is:
* Use pseudo elements :before, :after.
* Responcive layout and content.

## I used SASS(SCSS) 
* SASS(SCSS) is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

1. If you want to learn SASS(SCSS) go here: https://sass-lang.com/
